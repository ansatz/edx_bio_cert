## Q6
#Finding Differentially Methylated Regions in R Assessment Q6
#Now we will use the bumphunter package to separate the differentially methylated CpGs intro groups.

    
library(bumphunter)
X <- model.matrix(~pd$Status)
chr <- as.character(seqnames(gr))
res <- bumphunter(meth,X,chr=chr,pos=start(gr),cutoff=0.1)

  
From here we get a table of regions:

    
head(res$table)

  
Note that the bumphunter() function has options to assess uncertainty, which are turned on through the B argument. However, these options make this function computationally intensive. We therefore skip this step here and, instead of filtering by statistical significance, filter by region size.

    
dmrs <- res$table[ res$table$L>=3, ]

  
Note that this table is not a GenomicRanges object, but we can turn it into one easily:

    
dmrs <- makeGRangesFromDataFrame(dmrs)

  
For the regions in dmrs, find the distance to the closest island. (Hint: use distanceToNearest().)

What proportion of DMRs overlap a CpG island?
Hint: if a DMR overlaps an island, the distance to the closest island will be 0.
